# Hello, Folks! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px" height="30px" />

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Shivam Sharma, a DevSecOps Engineer🖥 passionate about building 🔒 secure and resilient software systems. With expertise in ☁️ cloud-native technologies and a focus on automating infrastructure🏗, , streamlining development workflows♾, and ensuring smooth deployment pipelines with security practices.🚀⚙🖥😎

🔒 Security is my top priority. 

☁️ Leveraging Azure DevOps and GitHub Actions, I automate build, test, and deployment processes, enabling teams to deliver high-quality software rapidly and reliably. Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines are my bread and butter.

🛡️ I specialize in implementing security controls, such as Azure Security Center, Azure Key Vault, and Azure Policy, to protect cloud environments from threats and vulnerabilities. I conduct regular security assessments and audits to ensure compliance with industry standards and regulations.

🚀 Passionate about collaboration and knowledge sharing, I actively contribute to open-source projects on GitHub and engage with the developer community through workshops, meetups, and online forums.

Let's connect and build secure, scalable, and resilient cloud solutions together! Feel free to reach out for collaboration opportunities or just to geek out about all things in Cloud and DevSecOps. 🚀
